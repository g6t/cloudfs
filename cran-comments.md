## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* **Updated the `Description` field in the `DESCRIPTION` file** to:
  - Place software names ('Google Drive' and 'Amazon S3') in single quotes as 
  per CRAN guidelines.
  - Add links to the respective web services for 'Google Drive' and 'Amazon S3'
  for clarity and compliance.

* **Removed examples from unexported functions.**

In response to the feedback, I have made the following changes to minimize the
use of the `\dontrun` tag:

* **Examples Updated to Execute Safely**:
  - In `cloud_read_excel.Rd` and `cloud_get_roots.Rd`, I introduced examples 
  that can be safely executed and removed the `\dontrun` tags.

* **Limited Use of `\dontrun`**:
  - For `cloud_local_ls.Rd`, I retained the `\dontrun` tag for only one example.

* **Conditional Execution with `\dontshow`**:
  The majority of the functions in the package require the user to associate the
  project directory with a cloud storage, a process that involves inserting a
  URL of a 'Google Drive' or an 'Amazon S3' folder into the console. For these
  functions, I wrapped the examples in `\dontshow` conditional on
  `interactive()`. The affected files include:
  - `cloud_drive_attach.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_browse.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_ls.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_upload.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_download.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_write.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_read.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_upload_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_download_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_write_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_read_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_drive_spreadsheet_autofit.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_attach.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_browse.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_upload.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_download.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_read.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_write.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_upload_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_download_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_write_bulk.Rd`
  - `cloud_s3_read_bulk.Rd`
